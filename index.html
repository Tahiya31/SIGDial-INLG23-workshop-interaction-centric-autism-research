    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
    Children-centered language-based interaction can help understand language development in
    children, identify deficits, and mediate targeted interventions for neuro-developmental disorders
    such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). [1] Developing language-based tools to enhance the
    diagnosis of autism poses several challenges.
        
    <li> Rich interaction datasets specifically focused on ASD individuals are a precursor for
    building such tools. Construction of such datasets, collected across different
    geographical areas, cultures, and races, is difficult and does not currently exist. Data
    sharing is another challenge due to privacy concerns and institutional constraints.</li>
        
    <li>Doctors use children's behavioral and developmental markers such as impaired social
    interaction, disordered verbal and non-verbal communications, and repetitive behaviors
    to make a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Bringing multimodal information to
    model social interaction during a conversation can provide a nuanced perspective in the
    diagnosis process.</li>
        
    <li>Researchers working in this research space come from a range of domains including
    psychology, linguistics, computer science, social science, and human-computer
    interaction. There is a need for conversation across the disciplines to find agreements
    about the measures needed for diagnosis and intervention.</li>

    <p>In this workshop, we aim to address these issues through a discussion of the following topics:</p>
        
        <li> Multimodal information processing of interactions involving people with symptoms of
        autism</li>
        <li>Datasets of autism behavior in child-child, child-parent, child-researcher and multi-party
        conversation</li> 
        <li>Bridging social science and AI techniques in autism understanding and diagnosis</li>
        <li>Speech recognition for autism speech</li>
        <li>Conversational tools for language development in autism</li>

        <li>AI-mediated tools for improved cognitive and social development in autism</li>
        <li>Dialogue modeling for autism diagnosis and intervention</li>
